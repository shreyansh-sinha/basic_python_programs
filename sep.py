#The separator between the arguments to print() function in Python is space by default (softspace feature) , 
#which can be modified and can be made to any character, integer or string as per our choice. 
#The ‘sep’ parameter is used to achieve the same, it is found only in python 3.x or later. 
#It is also used for formatting the output strings

#python doesn't support multi line comments

#code for disabling the softspace feature 
print('G','F','G', sep='') 
  
#for formatting a date 
print('09','12','2016', sep='-') 
  
#another example 
print('pratik','geeksforgeeks', sep='@')

print("shreyansh", end='\n')
